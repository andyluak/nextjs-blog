# Next js blog basics w/ MDX

## **Packages**

### **next-mdx-remote**

#### Needed to create a configuration file , that will read all the mdx files / parse them and then use my own components to render them.

#### _gray-matter_ package is being used to to get the actual data and meta data from the mdx files. After getting the data we serialize it and use our own components and plugins ( rehype plugins )
